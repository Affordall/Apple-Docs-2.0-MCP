# Apple Docs

Answer from Apple's own documentation instead of memory, with the Apple Docs 2.0 MCP server (`apple-docs`): API
reference with full signatures and OS availability, articles and tutorials, the Human Interface Guidelines, App Store
Connect Help, sample code, and 1,700 WWDC sessions (2014–2026) with transcripts and code.

## Connect

Installing this skill adds instructions only; it doesn't register the server. If the apple-docs tools aren't
available, add the server to your agent and restart it. In Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add apple-docs -- npx -y apple-docs-2.0-mcp
```

Other clients take the same command in their MCP settings: `"command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "apple-docs-2.0-mcp"]`.
No API key or account is needed.

## Use

- Before writing or fixing code that calls an Apple framework, search first with `search_apple_docs` (or
  `search_docs_map` for a name or part of one), then read the page with `get_apple_doc_content`.
- For working code, call `get_wwdc_code_examples` with the type the code uses, then `get_wwdc_video` for the session.
- For design questions, search with type `design` and read the guideline page.
- The server sends its own search instructions when it connects; follow them.
